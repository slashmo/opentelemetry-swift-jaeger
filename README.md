This library adds support for [Jaeger](https://jaegertracing.io/) to [OpenTelemetry Swift](https://github.com/slashmo/opentelemetry-swift).

## Development

### Formatting

To ensure a consistent code style we use [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat).
To automatically run it before you push to GitHub, you may define a `pre-push` Git hook executing
the *soundness* script:

```sh
echo './scripts/soundness.sh' > .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```
